# Product Requirements Document: Random Number Generator Core

## Introduction/Overview

The Random Number Generator Core is the fundamental feature for Phase 2 of the AiPricePulse project. This feature will implement ICP's native `raw_rand` system API to generate cryptographically secure random numbers, demonstrating the Internet Computer's unique verifiable randomness capabilities for hackathon judges and evaluators.

The goal is to create a functional MVP that showcases ICP's competitive advantage in blockchain randomness generation - providing instant, gas-free, cryptographically secure random numbers without external oracle dependencies.

## Goals

1. **Demonstrate ICP's Unique Randomness**: Successfully integrate and showcase ICP's native `raw_rand` system API
2. **Functional MVP Delivery**: Create a working random number generator for hackathon submission by deadline
3. **User Experience**: Provide a simple, intuitive interface with sub-second response times
4. **Technical Foundation**: Establish robust backend integration that can be extended in future phases
5. **Educational Value**: Clear demonstration of ICP's advantages over traditional blockchain randomness solutions

## User Stories

### Primary User Story

**As a hackathon judge**, I want to click a single button and see a random number generated instantly, so that I can evaluate the technical implementation and understand ICP's randomness capabilities.

### Secondary User Stories

**As a developer**, I want to see clean, well-documented code that demonstrates `raw_rand` integration, so that I can learn how to implement ICP randomness in my own projects.

**As a user**, I want the random number generation to work reliably without errors, so that I can trust the system's functionality.

**As a mobile user**, I want the interface to work smoothly on my phone, so that I can test the functionality on any device.

## Functional Requirements

### Backend Requirements (Rust Canister)

1. The system must implement a new canister function `generate_random_number()` using ICP's `raw_rand` system API
2. The function must return a random number in decimal format (converted from the raw bytes)
3. The function must handle API call failures gracefully with appropriate error messages
4. The function must be accessible via Candid interface for frontend integration
5. The function must execute within 2 seconds under normal network conditions
6. The function must use the `#[ic_cdk::update]` macro for proper canister integration

### Frontend Requirements (React/TypeScript)

7. The system must provide a single "Generate Random Number" button prominently displayed
8. The system must show loading state while random number generation is in progress
9. The system must display the generated random number clearly after successful generation
10. The system must show user-friendly error messages if generation fails
11. The system must be responsive and work on mobile devices (minimum 320px width)
12. The system must integrate with the existing backendService.ts pattern for API calls

### Integration Requirements

13. The random number generator must integrate seamlessly with the existing App.tsx component structure
14. The system must follow the existing UI patterns using the established Button and Card components
15. The backend service must be added to the existing backendService.ts file
16. The system must maintain consistency with the current Tailwind CSS styling approach

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

The following features are explicitly **NOT** included in Phase 2:

- **Number format options** (binary, hexadecimal display)
- **Range specification** (min/max values)
- **History tracking** or persistent storage
- **Batch generation** of multiple numbers
- **Export functionality** (CSV/JSON downloads)
- **Statistical analysis** or verification tools
- **Advanced UI features** (animations, complex layouts)
- **User authentication** or personalization
- **API endpoints** for external access
- **Performance optimization** beyond basic requirements

## Design Considerations

### UI/UX Requirements

- **Simplicity First**: Single button interface following the existing component patterns
- **Consistent Styling**: Use existing Tailwind CSS classes and component structure
- **Mobile Responsive**: Ensure functionality on screens 320px and wider
- **Loading States**: Clear visual feedback during API calls
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages without technical jargon

### Component Structure

```
RandomGeneratorView.tsx
├── Card component (existing)
├── Button component (existing)
├── Loading component (existing)
└── Error handling (existing pattern)
```

### Integration Points

- Add new view to App.tsx component structure
- Extend backendService.ts with new API call
- Follow existing error handling and loading state patterns

## Technical Considerations

### Dependencies

- **Required**: `ic_cdk::api::management_canister::raw_rand` for backend implementation
- **Existing**: Current React/TypeScript frontend stack
- **Existing**: PocketIC testing infrastructure for integration tests

### Backend Implementation Approach

```rust
use ic_cdk::api::management_canister::raw_rand;

#[ic_cdk::update]
async fn generate_random_number() -> Result<u64, String> {
    match raw_rand().await {
        Ok((random_bytes,)) => {
            // Convert first 8 bytes to u64 for decimal display
            let random_number = u64::from_be_bytes(/* conversion logic */);
            Ok(random_number)
        }
        Err(e) => Err(format!("Failed to generate random number: {:?}", e))
    }
}
```

### Frontend Service Integration

```typescript
async generateRandomNumber(): Promise<u64> {
    return await backend.generate_random_number();
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Backend**: Return Result<u64, String> for proper error propagation
- **Frontend**: Use existing error handling patterns with user-friendly messages
- **Network**: Handle timeout and connection errors gracefully

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success Criteria

1. **Functionality**: Random number generation succeeds 99%+ of the time under normal conditions
2. **Performance**: Average response time under 2 seconds from button click to number display
3. **Error Handling**: All error conditions display appropriate user messages
4. **Integration**: Feature integrates seamlessly with existing codebase

### User Experience Success Criteria

5. **Usability**: Single-click operation requires no additional user input
6. **Mobile Compatibility**: Interface works correctly on mobile devices
7. **Visual Feedback**: Loading and success states are clearly indicated

### Demonstration Success Criteria

8. **Hackathon Readiness**: Feature works reliably during live demonstrations
9. **Educational Value**: Code clearly demonstrates ICP's randomness advantages
10. **Professional Quality**: Implementation follows established code quality standards

## Open Questions

1. **Number Display Format**: Should the random number be displayed with thousands separators for readability?
2. **Error Recovery**: Should there be an automatic retry mechanism for failed generations?
3. **Testing Strategy**: What specific test cases should be prioritized for the PocketIC integration tests?
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Should we add basic performance metrics (generation time) to the UI?
5. **Accessibility**: Are there specific accessibility requirements for the button and display elements?
